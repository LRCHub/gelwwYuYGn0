I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through

To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometime
And I want to spend some time with you
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building the castle in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I
We look for love no time for tears
Wasted water all this is
They don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come for those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We gotta go for all we know
Just the two of us
Oh We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building the castle in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Oh just the two of us
Building the castle in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I
(Just the two of us)
(We can make it if we try)
(Just the two of us)
Oh oh
(Just the two of us)
(Building the castle in the sky)
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
Yes you and I
Yes you and I
