I see the crystal raindrops fall, and the beauty of it all
When the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind, when I think of you sometimes
And I wanna spend some time with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
I mean I'm in my fields and my daily dose is always high
I'm thinkin' imma pop a pill, nah I'll make it by
Poppin' pills again, fuck it, I didn't die
I think about this every day, didn't really say goodbye
Always lost inside myself, I never cry
Laying down in my bed, thinking about the blue sky
Get a chair ready, grab the news, and then I make a time

To make those rainbows in my mind, when I think of you sometimes
And I wanna spend some time with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
I see the crystal raindrops fall, and the beauty of it all
